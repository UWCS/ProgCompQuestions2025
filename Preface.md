# UWCS Programming Competition 2025 

Welcome to this year's UWCS ProgComp! 

The questions range massively in difficulty:
- the first 2 questions (**A**, **B**) are aimed at beginners
- the next 2 questions (**C**, **D**) are meant to be a challenge for beginners
- the remaining questions are meant to be for the experienced competitive programmer so please don't feel discouraged if you can't solve them! Equally, please don't be scared of them even if you're a beginner and maybe give them a go :)

**Tip:** Note that solutions to all the problems exist that run in under a minute. If your solution is taking longer than a minute to execute, then it could be that there's a better way to solve the problem! Some of these problems are designed such that there are obvious solutions to solve the problem, but which run too slowly.

A huge thank you to our fresher reps Thomas Facos and Edward O'Dwyer for organising the competition this year, and to Discrimson for his invaluable help with writing the harder programming questions!
This event simply wouldn't have been possible without them.

We hope you have fun solving this year, 
UWCS Academic Team
