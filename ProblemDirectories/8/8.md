# VIII. C.O.B.E.N

**Skiwi** the Frog enters the **Mathmos** into a multiplayer Nim tournament. However, they don't know the optimal strategy and thus play no better than random.

You are given $n$ players with their current scores $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ and $n$ non-negative bonuses $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$. In the next round, each player will randomly receive one of the bonuses. The player with the lowest total score after the round will be eliminated. **In the event of a tie for the lowest total score among $k$ players, one of them is eliminated uniformly at random, with each having a probability of $\frac{1}{k}$.**

Your task is to calculate, for each player $i$, the exact probability of being eliminated after the next round, returned modulo $998244353$.

### Input
The first line contains $t \\; (1 \leqslant t \leqslant 60)$, the number of test cases.

Then, $t$ test cases follow, and for each test case:

- The first line contains one integer $n \\, (1 \leqslant n \leqslant 150)$.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers, where $p_i \\, (0 \leqslant p_i \leqslant 10^9)$ represents the current score of player $i$.
- The third line contains $n$ space-separated integers, where $s_i \\, (0 \leqslant s_i \leqslant 10^9)$ represents the score bonus associated with the $i^{\text{th}}$ place.

### Subtasks

#### Subtask 1 [16%]
$n \leqslant 8$ and it is guaranteed that no matter how the bonuses are allocated, there will never be a tie between two players.

#### Subtask 2 [34%]
It is guaranteed that no matter how the bonuses are allocated, there will never be a tie between two players.

#### Subtask 3 [50%]
No further constraints.

### Output
For each test case, output a single line containing $n$ integers, space-separated, where the $i^{\text{th}}$ integer represents the probability $\pmod{998244353}$ that player $i$ is eliminated.

It can be shown that the expected value has the form $\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are non-negative coprime integers, and $Q \neq 0$. Report the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{998244353}$.

### Note
We have 3 players with current scores $p = [60, 40, 20]$ and bonus options $s = [100, 50, 25]$. There are $3! = 6$ ways to assign the 3 bonuses, and in each assignment, the player with the lowest total $(p_i + s_{\pi(i)})$ is eliminated. Enumerating:

1. $[160, 90, 45] \to$ Player 3 is eliminated.
2. $[160, 65, 70] \to$ Player 2 is eliminated.
3. $[110, 140, 45] \to$ Player 3 is eliminated.
4. $[110, 65, 120] \to$ Player 2 is eliminated.
5. $[85, 140, 45] \to$ Player 3 is eliminated.
6. $[85, 90, 120] \to$ Player 1 is eliminated.

**Player 1** is eliminated in 1 of 6 permutations ($\frac{1}{6}$).

**Player 2** is eliminated in 2 of 6 permutations ($\frac{1}{3}$).

**Player 3** is eliminated in 3 of 6 permutations ($\frac{1}{2}$).

A tie is possible for the last test case; if we allocate the score bonus $5$ to player 1 and the score bonus $4$ to player 2, both end with a total score of $8$. Therefore, we begin the procedure and uniformly pick one of them at random, which means they each have a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of being eliminated if those score bonuses are allocated in that manner. The probabilities of elimination over all permutations are $\frac{3}{4}$ for player 1 and $\frac{1}{4}$ for player 2.
