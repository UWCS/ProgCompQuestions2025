A single line containing $n$ integers, space separated, where the $i^{\text{th}}$ integer represents the probability $\text{mod } 998244353$ that player $i$ is eliminated.

It can be shown that the expected value has the form $\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are non-negative coprime integers, and $Q \neq 0$. Report the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{998244353}$.
