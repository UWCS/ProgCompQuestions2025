# VI. Treejumper

**Skiwi** loves trees, so you decide to gift him a computer science tree rooted at 1. To make things exciting, you hide money in some of the nodes. Skiwi wants to collect all the money as quickly as possible—he’s on a deadline with an essay to write. Each edge takes him **one second** to traverse, and he **starts at the root node (1)**. What is the minimum amount of time Skiwi needs to collect all the money? 

**Note: Skiwi does not need to return to the root.**

### Input
The first line contains $t \\; (1 \leqslant t \leqslant 100)$, the number of test cases.

Then, $t$ test cases follow, and for each test case:

- The first line contains one integer $n \\, (1 \leqslant n \leqslant 2 \cdot 10^5)$, the number of nodes in the tree.
- Then, $n-1$ lines follow, each containing two integers that are space-separated, $u,v \\, (1 \leqslant u,v \leqslant n)$, denoting an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$.


### Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer for each test case, representing the minimum time in seconds for Skiwi to grab all the money.
