# V. Wall-o-buttons

A wall has $n$ buttons stacked vertically. **Skiwi** the Frog loves pressing buttonsâ€”but there's a catch! Skiwi can press any button as long as the button directly above and directly below it (if they exist) remain unpressed. Skiwi wants to know how many ways he can press these buttons while satisfying this criterion.

Two configurations are considered the same if the arrangement of pressed buttons *at the end* are the same. 

Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Input
The first line contains $t \\; (1 \leqslant t \leqslant 100)$, the number of test cases.

Then, $t$ test cases follow, and for each test case:

- The first line contains one integer $n \\, (1 \leqslant n \leqslant 10^{18})$.

### Subtasks

#### Subtask 1 [40%]
$n \leqslant 10^5$

#### Subtask 2 [60%]
No further constraints.

### Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer for each test case, representing the number of ways to press the buttons $\mod{10^9 + 7}$.

### Example Input
```
4
1
3
5
93821993237
```

### Example Output
```
2
5
13
642845733
```

### Note
In the first case, there are $2$ options, either Skiwi presses the button or he doesn't.
