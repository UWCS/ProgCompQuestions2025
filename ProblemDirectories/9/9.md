# IX. Fresher's Sum

**Skiwi** the Frog is writing his seminal paper on the wonderful beauty of the fractions. The **smaller** the denominator (but still positive), the more beautiful the fraction. Skiwi wants a nice way of finding the most beautiful fraction that lies strictly between two other fractions.

More precisely, find the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ with the **smallest positive denominator** $b$ such that $\frac{p}{q} < \frac{a}{b} < \frac{u}{v}$.

### Input
The first line contains $t \\; (1 \leqslant t \leqslant 1000)$, the number of test cases.

Then, $t$ test cases follow, and for each test case:

- The first line contains four integers $p,q,u,v \\; (1 \leqslant p,q,u,v \leqslant 10^{18})$, representing $\frac{p}{q}$ and $\frac{u}{v}$ with $\frac{p}{q} < \frac{u}{v}$.

### Subtasks

#### Subtask 1 [15%]
$p,q,u,v \leqslant 10^5$

#### Subtask 2 [85%]
No further constraints.

### Output
For each test case, output two integers $a$ and $b$, space separated, that satisfies $\frac{p}{q} < \frac{a}{b} < \frac{u}{v}$ and with $b$ minimal.
If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any.

### Example Input
```
4
43 197 17 77
5 4 4 3
3 17 169 931
227 730 11 35
```

### Example Output
```
7 32
9 7
5 28
5 16
```

### Note
For the second test case, it can be shown that $\frac{5}{4} < \frac{9}{7} < \frac{4}{3}$ and $7$ is the smallest possible integral denominator that fits.
