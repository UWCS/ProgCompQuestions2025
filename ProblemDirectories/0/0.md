Reverse
=======




This sample problem is about reversing strings. It does not count towards your score (or PDP for first years).

# Input
* The first line of the input contains an integer $n$ - the number of test cases.
* The next $n$ input lines are strings $(s_1, s_2, . . . , s_n)$ of only lowercase characters.

## Constraints
$$ 1 \leq n \leq 102; \forall i \in \\{ 1, \dots , n \\}: 1 \leq |s_i| \leq 102 $$

# Output
$n$ lines, with line $i$ being the characters of the string $s_i$ in reverse order.

# Example

## Input
```
3
hello
goodbye
helloagain
```

## Output
```
olleh
eybdoog
niagaolleh
```
