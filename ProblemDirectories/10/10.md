# X. C.O.B.E.N (Extreme Version)

**Skiwi** the Frog enters the **Mathmos** into a multiplayer Nim tournament. However, they don't know the optimal strategy and thus play no better than random.

You are given $n$ players with their current scores $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ and $n$ non-negative bonuses $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$. In the next round, each player will randomly receive one of the bonuses. The player with the lowest total score after the round will be eliminated. In the event of a tie for the lowest total score among $k$ players, one of them is eliminated uniformly at random, with each having a probability of $\frac{1}{k}$.

**Skiwi has decided to participate in this tournament as well. He is Player 1 and since he is a Nim Master$^{\text{TM}}$, he is guaranteed to receive the highest score bonus.**

Your task is to calculate, for **Skiwi** (Player 1), the exact probability of being eliminated after the next round, returned modulo $998244353$.

### Input
The first line contains $t \\; (1 \leqslant t \leqslant 12)$, the number of test cases.

Then, $t$ test cases follow, and for each test case:

- The first line contains one integer $n \\, (1 \leqslant n \leqslant 10^6)$.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers, where $p_i \\, (0 \leqslant p_i \leqslant 10^9)$ represents the current score of player $i$.
- The third line contains $n$ space-separated integers, where $s_i \\, (0 \leqslant s_i \leqslant 10^9)$ represents the score bonus associated with the $i^{\text{th}}$ place.


### Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer for each test case, representing the probability $\text{mod } 998244353$ that player $1$ aka **Skiwi** is eliminated.

It can be shown that the expected value has the form $\frac{P}{Q}$, where $P$ and $Q$ are non-negative coprime integers, and $Q \neq 0$. Report the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{998244353}$.

### Example Input

```

### Example Output
```
748683265
0
499122177
```

### Note
In the first case, Skiwi has a current score of $5$ and since he is the best Nim player, he is guaranteed to receive the $+80$. Unfortunately, this doesn't guarantee him safety as player 2 can get the $+50$ and player 3 the $+25$ leaving Skiwi in last.
