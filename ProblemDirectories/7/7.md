# VII. Skiwi's Jewels

The incredible **Skiwi the Frog** has a peculiar taste in treasures.

The Queen of the Dominion has laid out $n$ chests in a row, each containing a certain number of treasures. Skiwi may choose any chest as his starting point and begin picking treasures. From each chest, he can select any number between 1 and the amount available, but the number of treasures he picks must **strictly increase** as he moves to the next chest. He must stop once he can no longer pick a strictly greater number. 

Skiwi's goal is to maximize the total sum of treasures he collects under these rules.
 
More formally, given a sequence of integers $a$, where each $a_i$ represents the maximum selectable value at position $i$, determine the maximum sum of a *strictly increasing contiguous subarray*. 

A strictly increasing contiguous subarray is defined as a subarray of consecutive positions in \( [l, r] \), such that there exists a sequence of integers $b_l, b_{l+1}, \dots, b_r$, where: 

1. $b_i$ is an integer such that $1 \leqslant b_i \leqslant \text{a}_i$,
2. $b_l < b_{l+1} < \dots < b_r$,
3. The sum $b_l + b_{l+1} + \dots + b_r$ is maximized.

Your task is to output the maximum sum of such a sequence for the given input.

### Input
The first line contains $t \\; (1 \leqslant t \leqslant 150)$, the number of test cases.

Then, $t$ test cases follow, and for each test case:

- The first line contains one integer $n \\, (1 \leqslant n \leqslant 10^6)$.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers, where $a_i \\, (0 \leqslant a_i \leqslant 10^9)$ represents the value of the treasure at position $i$.

### Subtasks

#### Subtask 1 [40%]
$n \leqslant 2000$

#### Subtask 2 [60%]
No further constraints.

### Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer, the maximum treasure Skiwi stands to gain.

### Example Input
```
3
3
5 4 3
3
10 1 100
6
2 9 4 7 5 2
```

### Example Output
```
7
101
16
```

### Note
For the first test case, we may choose $[1,2]$ as the range and the numbers
$[{\color{red} {\underbrace{5}_3,\underbrace{4}_4}},3]$ which gives $7$.

For the third test case, we may choose $[1,4]$ as the range and the numbers
$[{\color{red} {\underbrace{2}_2,\underbrace{9}_3, \underbrace{4}_4, \underbrace{7}_7}},5,2]$ which gives $16$.
